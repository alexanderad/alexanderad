      <description>As you probably heard we&amp;rsquo;ve moved to Thailand. Good news is that I took quadcopter with me. Reasoning is simple: we have summer here all year around, while in Europe it is winter / no-flights season.
Almost everything went smoothly with transportation: I got no security questions regarding disassembled copter parts in checked in baggage. It is well known fact that LiPo batteries are not allowed for air transportation due to safety reasons, so that I need to buy those here.</description>
