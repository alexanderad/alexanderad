<h4 id="what-it-is-all-about">What it is all About</h4>

<p>So here I&rsquo;m going to post the log of Awesome Quadro-copter build. I can&rsquo;t promise you anything, like, keeping it up to date. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll try to do that.</p>

<h4 id="the-idea">The Idea</h4>

<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m trying to recover in my mind what made me thinking about building a quadro. At some point I found nice inspirational video. That reminds me of my institute, which I, say, hated at moment of my studying in there. Things changed since that and if I were able to time machine back I would have changed my attitude slightly&hellip; Heh, that does not matter much anymore.
Beside that now I understand that building a quadro and posting a build log for that is perfect topic for Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree diploma in my KPI&rsquo;s Computer Science faculty.</p>

<p>It has all the required sections covered:</p>

<ul>
<li>programmable micro-controller, which serves as a flight controller for copter</li>
<li>control theory heavily applied in order to achieve stable flight and reacting on accelerometer and gyro data</li>
<li>selection and comparison of components, here we have a wide choice, since we need motors, ESCs or electronic speed controllers, batteries and flight controller itself; frame and all other stuff required for mounting; components in this list have a set of certain parameters, which are dependent on each other</li>
<li>despite fact most flight controllers come pre-flashed with firmware they are still programmable through standard interfaces and there is a lot of space for creativity
Building the software is probably a topic for Master&rsquo;s if you want to dive more into scientific part rather than engineering.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, this video was kinda decisive argument in this idea of building own quadro. I can&rsquo;t say for sure now what is more important, the process of building a quadro or the result itself.</p>

<h4 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h4>

<p>I started the research on that and after two weeks of reading forums, watching dozens of videos, playing with copters calculators I made an order with first, initial list of components. That was not an easy part, believe me. At some point trying to conform components in a perfect way I understood that I can fail to make and order at all.</p>

<h4 id="requirements">Requirements</h4>

<p>I need copter to thrust at least 500 grams of payload, it is FPV camera. Total weight of copter without any payload is 1.2 kg. I&rsquo;m also expecting flight duration up to 10 minutes.</p>

<h4 id="buy-list">Buy List</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m skipping transmitter/receiver and battery charger since one friend of mine has all that and can borrow me for a while.</p>

<ul>
<li>Frame: X550 Glass Fiber Frame</li>
<li>Motors: 4 x NTM Prop Drive Series 28-30S 900 kv / 270W</li>
<li>ESCs: 4 x TURNIGY Plush 25A</li>
<li>Flight Controller: KK 2.1.5 with 6050MPU gyro/acc and ATMega 664</li>
<li>Batteries: ZIPPY Compact 2200mAh 3S 25C Lipo Pack</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made in total three separate orders from different sources one of them has already arrived on Friday and two are on their way to Ukraine. I&rsquo;m going to make an overview of frame assembly in next post.</p>
